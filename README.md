Summary
---
As described on sourceforge:
"
cppcrypto provides optimized implementations of cryptographic primitives.

Hash functions: BLAKE, BLAKE2, Groestl, JH, Kupyna, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, SHAKE, Skein, SM3, Streebog, Whirlpool.

Block ciphers: Anubis, Aria, Camellia, CAST-256, Kalyna, Kuznyechik, Mars, Serpent, Simon-128, SM4, Speck-128, Threefish, Twofish, and Rijndael (AES) with all block and key sizes.

Stream ciphers: HC-128, HC-256, Salsa20, XSalsa20, ChaCha, XChaCha.

Encryption modes: CBC, CTR.

MAC functions: HMAC, Poly1305.

Key derivation functions: PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2 (Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id).

Includes sample command-line tools:
- 'digest' - for calculating and verifying file checksum(s) using any of the supported hash algorithms (similar to md5sum or RHash).
- 'cryptor' - for file encryption using Serpent-256 algorithm (CBC mode with HMAC).
